# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview

This challenge was to understand unsupervised learning, what it is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. For this challenge, I prepared an analysis for our clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. This analysis report shows what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for the new investment. The data was processed to fit the machine learning model: unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, I used a clustering algorithm, then used data visualizations to share the findings.
